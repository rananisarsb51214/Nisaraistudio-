## Description

Nisaraistudio- is a React-based portfolio website demonstrating dynamic UI elements and interactive components, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. While the repository's description hints at a broader AI Website Builder and Development Agent, the current codebase focuses on a functional frontend portfolio showcasing interactive elements like an animated modal for project details and a contact form.

## Features ✨

- **Interactive Portfolio Display:** Showcases a list of portfolio items with descriptive titles and short descriptions.
- **Animated Project Modals:** Clicking on a portfolio item opens a modal with detailed information, including full description and technologies used, enhanced with Framer Motion animations.
- **Animated Contact Form Modal:** A dedicated modal for users to submit contact information, also featuring smooth animations.
- **Dynamic UI Elements:** Utilizes `lucide-react` for icons and `motion` from Framer Motion for engaging animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring the application is responsive across different devices.
- **Vercel Analytics Integration:** Includes `@vercel/analytics` for tracking user engagement.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Languages:** TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
    - **React:** Core UI library (`react`, `react-dom`)
    - **Vite:** Build tool and development server (`vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@tailwindcss/vite`)
    - **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework (`tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`)
    - **Framer Motion:** Animation library (`motion`)
    - **Lucide React:** Icon library (`lucide-react`)
    - **Vercel Analytics:** Performance monitoring (`@vercel/analytics`)
- **AI Integration (Stated Purpose):** `@google/genai` (though not actively used in the current frontend implementation).
- **Backend (Stated Purpose):** `express` (though not actively used in the current frontend implementation).

## Installation ⬇️

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rananisarsb51214-web/Nisaraistudio-
    cd Nisaraistudio-
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project uses npm and Vite. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables (Optional for local development):**
    The project utilizes `dotenv`. If you need to configure environment-specific variables (like API keys for Google AI, as suggested by `vite.config.ts`), create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```
    GEMINI_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

## Usage 💡

This project serves as a demonstration of a modern React frontend with advanced UI/UX features.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and view the portfolio website:

1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Follow the **Installation** steps above.
3.  Run the development script:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (as configured in `package.json`).

### Interacting with the Portfolio

-   **Explore Portfolio:** Click the "Explore Portfolio" button on the main page.
-   **View Project Details:** Click on any portfolio card to open an animated modal that displays the full project description, the technologies used, and a link (currently set to '#') to the project.
-   **Contact Me:** Click the "Contact Me" button to open a modal with a contact form. Submitting the form will trigger a simple JavaScript alert and close the modal.

## How to Use 🧑‍💻

The current codebase provides a functional frontend portfolio website that demonstrates the capabilities of React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for creating engaging user interfaces.

-   **Portfolio Exploration:** Navigate through the project cards to see how details are presented in an animated modal.
-   **Contact Form Interaction:** Test the contact form submission (which currently shows an alert).
-   **Animation Showcase:** Observe the smooth transitions and animations in modals using `motion` and `AnimatePresence`.

This serves as a foundation that could be extended. The broader vision of Nisaraistudio as an AI Website Builder is described in the repository's documentation but is not fully implemented in this frontend-focused code.
